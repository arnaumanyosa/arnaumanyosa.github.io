<div class="h2">Problem</div>
<p>Everybody is interested in finding good deals while shopping or going out with friends, but how to find them? Checking on each company's website or store is obviously not doable.

<p class="headline">With Advertips you can find hundreds of stores, bars and restaurants around you that offer discounts in their products.

<div class="h2">Solution</div>
With Advertips you can find hundreds of stores, bars and restaurants around you that offer discounts in their products. You can filter by a minimum discount percentatge, by kind of products and radius of search. The solution also provides notifications that alert you when passing by a store offering the discount.
