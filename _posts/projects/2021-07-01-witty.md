<div class="h2">Problem</div>
<p>
Nowadays we are all interconnected through different technologies. What we express is potentially exposed to millions of people and everyday is more necessary to be inclusive when we communicate.
</p>
<div class="h2">Solution</div>
<p>Our first solution is a tool that analyses the text user types on any website, suggests options to reformulate some expressions if it's the case and in the mid/long term teaches how to write in a more inclusive way. To do that we created a browser extension that can be installed on most used browsers nowadays and potentially supports any website.
</p>
<p class="headline">We created a browser extension that can be installed on most used browsers and potentially supports any website. The extension, together with a backend service, analyzes the text and gives you different insights focusing on inclusivity.
</p>
<div class="h2">Responsabilities</div>
<p>As the first developer who started implementing the browser extension my responsabilities were:
</p>
<ul class="attached-list">
  <li><b>Choose the technologies to be used.</b> React is the perfect tool to implement the UI on top of the extension API</li>
  <li><b>Try to create a multiplatform tool with a single codebase</b>. Several open source projects helped on this matter</li>
  <li><b>Focus especially on the User Experience</b></li>
</ul>
