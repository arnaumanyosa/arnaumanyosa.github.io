		<h2>Project Overview</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
			<p>
			Crystal+ is an IBM-internal, client-centric decision support platform based on cognitive and Big Data analytic technologies.
			</p>
			<p>
			The platform focus is identifying client patterns and insights. It dramatically reduces research time, resulting in an understanding of both the clientâ€™s business issues and industry competitiveness. This enables prospect identification, recommendations and development of value propositions.

		<h3>Natural Language Experience</h3>
		<p>
		The UX Design for this project has two main areas. The first and more important is the Natural Language Query. Our goal is that the user can type or talk directly to the device asking any kind of questions related to clients or business opportunities in a natural way. The first approach is to allow the user to ask questions and refine them, but the goal is to implement a UI that allow the user to establish conversations taking in consideration previous questions or context.
		</p>
		<p>
		The second challenge of this project is how to show to the user the huge amounts of data involved, in the most understandable and meaningful way.
		</p>
